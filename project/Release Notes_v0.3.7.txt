New at release 0.3.7 - Beta:

New Features:
  - Removed redundant Print Progress Bar
  - Moved the message bar to where the Progress Bar was, to consolidate the print time info on the screen
  - Added Home All and Disable Steppers buttons to the ABL Automatic screen, to support staying on that screen while iteratively adjusting the bed plate screws, when leveling silicone spacers using the bed mesh.

Bugfixes:

    None

Known Issues at this release:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- When it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

 - No Print Menu functions have been implemented

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)



NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
