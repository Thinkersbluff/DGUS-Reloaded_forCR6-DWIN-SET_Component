New at release 0.4.0 - Beta:

New Features:

    - Replaced the data entry number pad with the larger and more colourful one from CF6.1
    - Replaced the popup messages for confirming PAUSE, STOP and RESUME with the larger more colourful ones from CF6.1 
    - Now restore the runout sensor to the last selected state, in START_PRINT and at RESTART|FIRMWARE_RESTART

Bugfixes:


	

Known Issues at this release:

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)

	No work-around.

 - The logic intended to ensure that "time spent paused" is not included in the "total print duration" does not seem to be working. Further analysis of the code is required, to find the error(s).

	No work around.
 
CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
