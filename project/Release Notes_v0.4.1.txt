New at release 0.4.1 - Beta:

New Features:

    - Added the Nozzle LED On/Off control to the Print Status, Print Paused and Print Finished screens
      - No longer have to select Tune menu to access that control

    - Fixed the LED On/Off status display, to synchronize that display with the status shown in the Mainsail Toolhead Misc. controls
      - NOTE: Also means that when the LED ON/OFF response is delayed in Klipper, the status on the screen may blink back to the previous state, until the commanded change takes effect 

    - Added X, Y and Z "last_move" position displays to Print Status, Print Paused and Print Finished screens
      - Also now able to command X, Y, Z movement, from the Print Screen, but not from the Print Status or Print Paused screens

    - Added the Feed Rate, Flow Rate and Fan Speed controls to the Print Finished Screen.
      - Discovered that Feed Rate impacts Load/Unload filament speed.  
        - If modified during a print and not restored to 100% after a print, it can overspeed the extruder next time a Filament Change is performed. 
        - This change provides the user with one more chance to notice and restore that setting to 100% before returning to the Home Screen.

    - Removed Z Gcode Offset controls from Print Status and Print Paused screens
      - Prefer the LED ON/OFF control on the main page. Can select Tune menu to modify the Gcode Offset

    - Revised M73 code in t5uid1.py, to process M73 R_ commands.
      - NOTE that the M73 R parameter is in minutes, so seconds remaining are not available with this implementation
      - Some slicers send separate M73 commands for (P)rogress and (R)emaining, some combine them into a single M3 message. This implementation handles eiher technique correctly.

    - Added Print Time Elapsed and Print Time Remaining data displays to Print Status, Print Paused and Print Finished screens
      - Print Time Elapsed displays the Klipper variable 'printer.print_stats.print_duration'
        - This parameter is displayed as 0s until Klipper begins to draw the purge line in the gcode
        - This parameter stops incrementing when the print is PAUSEd, and resumes incrementing when the print is RESUMEd
      - Print Time Remaining displays the M73 R parameter, in Days, Hours and Minutes.
        - This parameter is displayed as 0s, until Klipper finds the first M3 R_ line in the gcode


Bugfixes:

    - The above changes mean it is no longer necessary to troubleshoot/fix the t5uid1.py bug where print time elapsed did not stop incrementing when the print was paused.

    - Orior to this release, the LED ON/OFF button did not keep synchroized with LED On/Off changes made through Mainsail.  Now it does
	

Known Issues at this release:

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)

	No work-around.
 
CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
