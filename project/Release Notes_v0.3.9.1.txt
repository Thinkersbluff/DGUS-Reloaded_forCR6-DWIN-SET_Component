New at release 0.3.9.1 - Beta:

New Features:

    - None

Bugfixes:

	- Fixed: PAUSED Tune and Stop buttons not working correctly (Issue#32)
	- Fixed: Brightness controls on SetUp menu are not working (Issue#33)
	- Fixed: Return from Automatic Bed Leveling screen should be to Leveling Menu (Issue#34)
	

Known Issues at this release:

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)

	No work-around.

 - The logic intended to ensure that "time spent paused" is not included in the "total print duration" does not seem to be working. Further analysis of the code is required, to find the error(s).

	No work around.

  - If PAUSE or STOP is pressed while the printer is waiting for a heater to achieve a temperature target, the printer may show the print paused screen, and may park the head, but not actually be paused... In such cases, when the target is achieved, the toolhead may move back to continue the print, with the screen still showing Print Paused. While parked, in that case, trying to change filament will instead result only in a "Busy..." message.

     Work around is either:
	- Avoid using PAUSE or STOP until after the printer completes printing the purge line
OR	- Upgrade the Klipper Component to v1.2.8
 


CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
