New at release 0.3.2 - Beta:


Page 0000 (Splash Screen):

 Updated version# on splash screen from 0.3.1 to 0.3.2

Page 0001 (Home Screen):

Updated v0.3-BETA tag to v0.3.2

Page 0009 (Calibrate Menu Screen)
  NOTE: Still need to review the Klipper code for this Offset function.  Can not tell whether it loads the calibrated Z offset value from Printer.cfg.  Would prefer to implement the Klipper Calibrate_Offset/Test/Save_Config approach, in a future release...

Page 0018 (Settings menu2)
Added Nozzle LED On/Off controls to Setup menu

Re-generated project bin files.

Rebuilt 32_screens.icl.


Known Issues at this release:

 - Z Offset function may not be working correctly? Needs further study.
 - No Print Menu functions implemented (yet)
 - Elapsed print time variable not working (suppressed until fixed)
 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up. They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
