New at release 0.3.8 - Beta:

New Features:
    None

Bugfixes:

    - Right-justified the Gcode Z Offset display fields, to fix Issue#27

Known Issues at this release:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- When it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

 - No Print Menu functions have been implemented

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)



NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
