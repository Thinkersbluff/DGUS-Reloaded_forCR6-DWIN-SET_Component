New at release 0.3.8 - Beta:

New Features:

    - Added Print menu
    - Added Save_Variables capability, with variables.cfg file stored in ~/klipper/klippy/extras/t5uid1 folder 
    - Added ability to repeat last print (plan to add general virtual SD Card browse and file select in a future release)
    - Added ability to Enable|Disable the Filament Runout Sensor from the Setup page
    - Added an alert when the status of the runout sensor changes
    - Reduced the automatic message clear cycle time to 10 seconds (was 30 seconds)
    - Added a "Printer Ready" message to the Home Screen (this also clears any messages still in display memory, when restarting the system.)
    - Updated the version number on the splash screen and the home screen

Bugfixes:

    - Now synchronize the displayed menu pages with the actual state of the machine, when Klipper or Mainsail cause an ongoing print to Cancel, Pause or Resume, to fix Issue#26
    - Right-justified the Gcode Z Offset display fields, to fix Issue#27
    - Now synchronize LED On|Off status on Setup Page with actual state of printer (previous releases could get out of synch with Mainsail)
    - Fixed pages.cfg to add fan_speed to the auto-updated variables. (Previously, if the user modified fan speed with the Mainsail client, the displayed status page did not show those changes)



Known Issues at this release:

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)

 - The logic intended to ensure that "time spent paused" is not included in the "total print duration" does not seem to be working. Further analysis of the code is required, to find the error(s).

CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-Time DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
