Last updated: 16 Nov 2024

New at release 0.4.2 - Stable:

New Features:

    - Added a scrollable list of the files on the Virtual SD Card, on the Print_Menu screen, 
    from which the user can select and print any .gcode file on their card.


    CAUTION: The filelist will include all .gcode files found in subfolders, and it will automatically sort the entire list
    in descending order of Date Last Modified.  It will NOT, however, display the subfolder names. 
    * This design is an advantage for folks like me who like to use long filenames
    * It will disadvantage users who prefer instead to use subfolders to separate multiple variants of a .gcode file.

Bugfixes:

    - Issue #8 was fixed in the DGUS-Reloaded.cfg file for 1.1.0.3 and 4.5.3 Creality motherboards.  
      * That fix is moot, since, the Repeat Last Print scripts are no longer used to control printing at this release
      * I have left it there as an example, in case anyone wishes to experiment with modifications to the new functionality, to restore the display of subfolder names

	Known Issues at this release:

 - If your Virtual SD Card contains any files which do NOT end in .gcode, the filelist should exclude that file.
  * If, however, while scrolling through the list, your system suddenly shuts down - check for any such files in ~/printer_data/gcodes. 
    Deleting those files should fix the problem.

 - The RESET and FIRMWARE RESET buttons on the splash screen do not work on power-up.
      They do work after a FIRMWARE RESET from the Mainsail Web client. (NOTE: This may not be "fixable" Klipper seems to need to initialize those remote controls while being reset...)
    	There is no work-around for this issue.
 
CAUTION:

 - The FONT (.HZK) file changed at release v0.3.3.
	- If it is included in the DWIN_SET folder, it slows the flashing process
	- That file is now in the "One-ime DWIN_SET files" folder
	- If you have not flashed it to your system before, you should copy that to DWIN_SET for one time
	- After flashing it once to the display, that file can again be removed from DWIN_SET
	- If you already flashed that file to your display, you do NOT need to flash it again.

Cheers!
